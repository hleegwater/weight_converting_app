# Weight converting app

A small app to convert food weights to volume, for cooking.

I once built this app because I did not have a weighing scale living in the USA, but I needed some calculations for cooking. The app converts the weight in a recipe to volume, for ingredients that I often used, by using its density. 

## Installation

The app was originally developed using Kivy, in Python 3.7, and still runs on python 3.9. I used Spyder for previews of the app.
